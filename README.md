## Summary

An application that creates, updates and deletes users, and their thoughts which also contain embedded documents. Embedded documents are documents with schemas of their own that are part of other documents.

This application is a backend server for a social network, which allows users to become friends, post thoughts, where other users including themselves are able to react to thoughts.

## Tools Used:

- Express
- Mongoose
- date-fns
- MongoDB Compass

#### Languages:

- JavaScript

#### MongoDB:

MongoDB is an open source NoSQL database management program. NoSQL is used as an alternative to traditional relational databases. NoSQL databases are quite useful for working with large sets of distributed data. MongoDB is a tool that can manage document-oriented information, store or retrieve information.

#### Mongoose:

Mongoose provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model your application data. It includes built-in type casting, validation, query building, business logic hooks and more, out of the box.

In simple words, Mongoose acts as an intermediate between mongodb and server side language(like NodeJs), providing you with a simple validation and query API to help you interact with your MongoDB database.
